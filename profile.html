	 	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	 	<h3>I was born in Gingoog City Misamis Oriental , As a teenager i enjoyed listening R&B , Reggae and I began to write songs.
	 	On 2010 I went to America to cast a song in X Factor. I sang popular song like "Let me love you" and from the 2004 album and "Turning point" of American R'n'B singer Mario for my audition. All three judges - Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger said "Yes" for my positively and and amazing performance.
        <br><br>
	 	At first, I auditioned as a solo artist, but I had dropped out of the competition at bootcamp. However, I was invited to continue the fight in the group: in my addition , it included Jimvoy, Romeo, Liam Payne and Aldrin. Subsequently, the band was called WALAY DIRECTION.</h3>
